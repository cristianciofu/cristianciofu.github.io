title: tail -f vs less +F
---

Today I read a nice article that explains why you should stop using `tail -f` and start using instead `less +F`.

It's true, not every time, but in most of the cases the `less` option it's a better one.

Read the full article [here](http://www.brianstorti.com/stop-using-tail) - _Brian Storti_ gives some nice examples that makes it easy to understand when to use `tail` and when to use `less`.
