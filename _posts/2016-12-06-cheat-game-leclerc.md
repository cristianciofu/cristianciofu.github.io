title: JS + Bookmarklet - cheat Grand Jeu "Memory de Noël" - E.Leclerc
---

Leclerc launched a Christmas "memory game" on their website. 

A friend saw that the process of choosing the same card is actually based on the id of the field so... I said it's a cool idea to cheat a little bit :)

That's what we developers do when we want to have some fun ;)

So, here's the link of the game : ["Memory de Noël" - E.Leclerc](http://www.memorydenoel.fr) 

The needed code :
