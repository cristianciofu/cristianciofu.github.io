title: Tech me up
---

Back in february 2015 I decided to move [my personal blog](http://www.iamchris.info) from Tumblr. 

And I did it. 

Then I said to myself that I would post on the blog both personal and technical posts. 

But, after thinking about it a little more, I decided that maybe it's not such a good idea to mix it all. 

> Beside that, writing tech related blog posts in english it's a good way to improve my "english skills".

So what was the best solution for a tech mini-blog? Well - **GitHub** of course :)

It's simple, it has _syntax-highlighting_ support out of the box and it supports **Markdown**.

Here I'll add different stuff I consider interesting : code snippets / links / cool stuff - mostly related to web development.

Et voil√†... let's do this :)
